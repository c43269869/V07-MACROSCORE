---

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### 🔴 **ISSUE 1: Missing CHF Currency Support**
**Problem**: Swiss Franc (CHF) was referenced in the model but not implemented in the codebase.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added complete CHF currency data in `ForexDataContext.tsx`
- Implemented CHF-specific employment calculation (inverted unemployment rate scale)
- Added CHF rate sensitivity (0.8) and risk classification (safe haven)
- Added CHF currency pairs: USD/CHF, EUR/CHF
- Updated data sources guide with Swiss-specific sources (SNB, SECO, SIX Swiss Exchange)

### 🔴 **ISSUE 2: Gold Outperformance Logic Error**
**Problem**: Risk-off detection used incorrect logic (`market.gldReturn > market.spyReturn + 5`) instead of tracking consecutive days.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added `goldOutperformDays` tracking to `MarketData` interface
- Implemented `updateGoldOutperformDays()` helper function
- Fixed regime detection to use "5+ consecutive days" logic
- Auto-calculation in data input component with visual indicator

### 🔴 **ISSUE 3: VIX 20-Day Rolling Window Management**
**Problem**: VIX percentile calculation used static array without proper rolling window functionality.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added `updateVIXHistory()` helper function for proper rolling window
- Implemented automatic VIX history management in context
- Added data validation for incomplete VIX datasets
- Fixed percentile calculation to handle edge cases

### 🔴 **ISSUE 4: GBP Risk Classification Error**
**Problem**: GBP was classified as "neutral" (0.2) instead of being included in risk-on beneficiaries.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Corrected GBP risk factor and included it in risk-on beneficiary list
- Updated `applyRiskAppetiteToCurrency()` function
- Added GBP to risk-on currency array: `['AUD', 'EUR', 'CAD', 'GBP']`

### 🟡 **ISSUE 5: Employment Metric Validation**
**Problem**: No currency-specific guidance for employment metrics led to potential user input errors.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added `EMPLOYMENT_METRICS` mapping with currency-specific guidance
- Implemented visual indicators for good/bad thresholds
- Added employment metric descriptions and calculation notes
- Currency-specific validation hints in data input interface

### 🟡 **ISSUE 6: Real Rate Display Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Real rate display didn't show the 1.5x multiplier used in actual calculations.

**✅ FIXED:**
- Added both raw real rate and model score display
- Improved transparency of calculation methodology
- Clear separation between display values and calculation values
